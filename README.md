# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# ParkOptix

**ParkOptix** is a smart parking and emissions-reduction mobile application designed to optimize parking at Walmart locations. It leverages real-time camera feeds, computer vision, and predictive analytics to guide customers to available parking spots, reduce vehicle idling, and streamline Pickup & Delivery operations.

## 🚗 Key Features
- 🅿️ **Smart Spot Detection** using OpenCV and overhead cameras
- 📲 **Real-time Parking Availability** via dynamic signage and in-app map
- 🔋 **Idle Alert System** to reduce CO₂ emissions
- ⚡ **EV Priority Guidance** to charging stations
- 📦 **Pickup Spot Reservation** based on driver ETA synced with Walmart APIs
- 📊 **AI Heatmaps** to predict peak parking demand

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native (iOS & Android)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Firebase
- **Computer Vision**: Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

## 🌱 Goal
To reduce parking congestion, lower CO₂ emissions from idling vehicles, and improve customer experience during pickups at Walmart stores.
